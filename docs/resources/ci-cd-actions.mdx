You can use the following **GitLab CI/CD** actions to automate your workflow:
- Whenever there is a change on the swagger file, the copilot actions will be updated automatically.
- Make sure to replace the environment variables (`$COPILOT_ID`, `$AUTH_TOKEN`) with your own values.
- If you want access to our API, please check this [link](/api-notes).

```yaml
stages:
  - update_copilot

update_copilot_actions:
  stage: update_copilot
  script:
    - >
      if git diff --name-only $CI_COMMIT_BEFORE_SHA $CI_COMMIT_SHA | grep -q "swagger.json"; then
        echo "Swagger file has changed. Updating Copilot actions..."
        
        # Delete all actions from Copilot using environment variables for ID and token
        curl --location --request DELETE "https://api.opencopilot.so/backend/actions/bot/$COPILOT_ID" \
        --header 'Accept: application/json' \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN"
        
        # Wait a bit for the delete action to propagate
        sleep 5
        
        # Import actions from the updated Swagger file using environment variables
        curl --location --request PUT "https://api.opencopilot.so/backend/actions/bot/$COPILOT_ID/import-from-swagger" \
        --header 'Accept: application/json' \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
        --form 'file=@"./swagger.json"'
        
        echo "Copilot actions updated."
      else
        echo "Swagger file not changed. No action needed."
