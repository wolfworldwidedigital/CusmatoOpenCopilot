description: "Learn how the copilot can handoff the conversation to a human agent."

Currently, human handoff is in beta and only available for a few customers. If you are interested in using this feature, please contact us at mo@opencopilot.so, and we will be happy to help you.


## What is this?
One of the most important features of the Copilot is the ability to handoff the conversation to a human agent. This is useful when the Copilot is unable to understand the user's request or when the user requests to speak to a human agent, we reialzed that most of the time angry customers are looking for a human agent to talk to and solve their problems.


## How does it work?

Once this system action is installed on your copilot, a `handoff` event could happen in 2 ways:

- When the user explicitly asks to talk to a human agent.
- When the copilot is unable to understand the user's request or felt that the user is angry and dissatisfied.

## How to detect `handoff` event?

**You can detect and handle the `handoff` event in two ways:**

- **Option 1:** By using `onHandoff` callback function:

  This function will give you the flexibility to handle the `handoff` event in your own way, common case is to direct the user to some sort of ticketing system or a live chat system.

  ```javascript
    // add this in the chat widget options object
    onHandoff(handoffPayload) {
            console.log("Handoff", handoffPayload);
    }
  ```

- **Option 2:** By using <a href="/widget/not-gen-ui">"respond with UI"</a> feature:

  You can use the "respond with UI" feature to handle the `handoff` event by rendering a custom UI to the user. for example, you can render a from to collect the user's contact information and the nature of the problem.

  ```javascript
    // add this in the chat widget options object
    components: [
          {
            key: "HANDOFF", // static
            component: (props: ComponentProps<HandoffPayloadType>) => {
              return props.data.summery;
            },
          },
        ],
  ```
## I want to use my own UI to handle the `handoff` event, how can I do that?
The same as defining a UI component you will do the same instead, the only difference is that you will use the `HANDOFF` key to define the UI component that will be rendered when the `handoff` event is triggered.

```javascript
  // add this in the chat widget options object
  components: [
        {
          key: "HANDOFF", // static
          component: (props: ComponentProps<HandoffPayloadType>) => {
            return props.data.summery;
          },
        },
      ],
```

## What does the `handoff` event payload look like?
The `handoff` event payload will contain the following information:

```json
{
  "summery": "full summery of the conversation, it can be used by the human agent to understand the context of the conversation faster",
  "sentiment": "neutral|angry|happy",
}
```
