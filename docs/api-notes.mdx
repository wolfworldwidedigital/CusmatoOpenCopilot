Our public APIs are in closed beta. If you are interested in using our APIs, please [contact us](mailto:mo@opencopilot.so) to request access.

# When to use the API Reference

You might need to use the API Reference when you want to:

- Integrate OpenCopilot with your existing CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, etc.)
- Automate the creation of copilots
- Automate the deletion of copilots
- Automate adding or removing actions to a copilot
- And maybe the most common use case: replace our UI with your own custom UI


We are happy to help you with any questions you might have about our APIs. Please [contact us](mailto:mo@opencopilot.so) and we will make sure to set you for success.
