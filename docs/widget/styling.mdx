The widget is styled using tailwindcss.
so it is hard to overwrite the styles of let's say the basic elements such as buttons, inputs, etc.
but when it comes to placing the widget we provided an easy way to manage this via `containerProps` prop(if you are using the standalone) or option if you are using the pre-built script.

## The Default Widget Container Styles
the widget is fluid by default and it will take the full width of the parent container.

## containerProps
`containerProps` is an object that you can pass to the widget to style the container of the widget.
it can accept any valid html attributes such as `className`, `id`, `style`, etc.
