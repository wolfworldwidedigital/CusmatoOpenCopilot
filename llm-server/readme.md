## **Getting Started Guide: Debugging "opencopilot" with VS Code**

This section guides you through setting up your environment and using VS Code for debugging the "opencopilot" Flask application.

### **Prerequisites**

#### *Conda Installation*

Install Conda by following the [official Conda installation guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html), then check your Conda version with `conda --version`.

#### *Mypy Installation (Optional)*

For an enhanced development experience with Mypy (optional), activate your Conda environment and run `pip install mypy`.

### **Copilot LLM Flask Application Setup**

#### *Prerequisites*

1. Clone the "opencopilot" Flask App repository onto your local machine.

## **Environmental Configuration**

Configure the "llm\_server" project environment as follows:

1. **Create `.env` File**: At the root of the "llm\_server" directory, create a new `.env` file to hold environmental configuration settings for local development.

   Example `.env` File:
   ```ini
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR OPEN AI KEY>
   ```

2. **Set Additional Environment Variables (Optional)**
   Set any desired optional environment variables for copilot customization within the `.env` file.

   Optional variable examples include:
   ```js
      - `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string.
      - `QDRANT_SERVER_URI`: QDRANT server URL.
      - `QDRANT_API_KEY`: Your QDRANT API key.
      - `QDRANT_PASS`: Base64-encoded string for QDRANT pass.
      - `ACTIONS_SCORE_THRESHOLD`: Threshold for actions score (default: 0.5).
      - `FLOWS_SCORE_THRESHOLD`: Threshold for flows score (default: 0.5).
      - `KB_SCORE_THRESHOLD`: Threshold for KB score (default: 0.5).
      - `TARGET`: Environment target (default: production).
   ```
   Replace placeholders with appropriate configurations. For more information about these options, see the original documentation.

### **Project Dependencies**

To install required packages, execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the project directory.

### **Debugging Locally with VS Code**

1. Select the 'Flask' debug configuration.
2. Launch debug mode with F5.

### **Docker Debugging**
With Docker and Docker Compose installed, perform the following tasks:

1. In the Makefile, set `TARGET=development`.
2. Execute either `make install` or `make install-arm`, depending on your system architecture.
3. Within the "llm-server" directory, locate the Docker container for debugging purposes.
4. Attach the VSCode debugger to the running container for debugging. Wait for the Flask process to begin before proceeding.

Benefit from convenient hot reloading while debugging inside Docker containers without needing to restart the container after every code modification.

Happy debugging! ðŸš€

## **Use Open Source Model Environment Variables**

To use the open-source model, set the following environment variables, thanks to [Justin van Grootveld](https://github.com/jvgrootveld):

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=unused
CHAT_MODEL=openchat
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openchat
LOCAL_IP=http://host.docker.internal
VECTOR_SIZE=4096
```


## File Storage Configuration

The following environment variables are used to configure the file storage for the application:

- `STORAGE_TYPE`: Specifies the type of file storage to be used. Currently, the supported options are `s3` and `local`. Set this variable to `s3` if you want to use Amazon S3 for file storage, or set it to `local` if you want to use the local file system.

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (required if `STORAGE_TYPE` is set to `s3`): Specifies the access key ID for the AWS account that has access to the S3 bucket. This key is used to authenticate requests made to the S3 service.

- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (required if `STORAGE_TYPE` is set to `s3`): Specifies the secret access key for the AWS account that has access to the S3 bucket. This key is used to authenticate requests made to the S3 service.

Make sure to provide the appropriate values for these environment variables based on your desired file storage configuration.
